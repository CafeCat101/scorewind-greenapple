This can interrupt the flow your your scale, leading you to not play legato, or press notes wrongly, resulting in a noise. The best way to make position changes during scales is to use the moment you reach to an open string note. Since you're not pressing any note at that moment, your hand is free to move to the next position, without interrupting the sound. Thus, when you reach to the open E on the first string, you'll\u00a0 use that moment to drag your 3rd finger from D to F# on the second string. That way you successfully transfer your hand from the 1st to the 5th position.</p>\n \n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>",

Following the ternary bar with the movement of your body can help you feel better this waltz-like sensation.

								"lesson_content": "<p>by ScoreWind Teachers</p>\n<p>A minor is one of the most common arpeggios to be played on the guitar. Yet, it comes with a high degree of challenge if you want to make it right and, eventually, effortlessly. It's very important to have a well ronded left hand when playing this or any other melodic arpeggio. Reserve your 4th finger to play the low C on the 5th string, and the high A on the 1st string. If you place this finger well (close to the fretboard and horizontally aligned with the 1st finger) you will see that the rest of your fingers will follow the good positioning, and playing this arpeggio will become much easier.</p>\n \n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>",

Focus on having a good horizontal alignement between the 1st and 4th finger, and that there is always a fair amount of space between your fingers (this will help you a lot, not only in this case, but for your whole left hand positioning foundation).

The biggest challenge you will encounter in this scale is the incredible extension in the first string between the notes e, f, g, a; an up to the fifth fret stretch. The key here is to open up your left hand knuckles as you reach to the f, in order to be prepared to play the g and the a, and later be ready to descend on the scale. With this type of preparation you will be saving time and effort. As you can see in the video, my elbow is nearly touching the guitar, and I even bring my left shoulder slightly down to keep my fourth finger with a well rounded shape as I reach to the A on the fifth fret.</p>",

It is always that one value (a half, quarter, eight, sixteenth note) plus its half; so, one and a half value every time. In this case our dotted rhythm will be done with 8th and 16th notes. First you will only play a base of 8th notes, then you\u2019ll subdivide every second 8th note into two 16th notes, and finally you will omit the first 16th note and add the value of that note to the 8th note that you just played.
