Sometimes you will find a piece where you will be playing a dotted rhythm pattern in a constant, and in other situations the appearance of this precise rhythmical figure is crucially placed in individual musical moments. Dotted rhythm was frequently used by the guitar composers of the Classical-Romantic era, and they have left us an enormous source with which we can master this characteristic figure.\n\nThe method consists of an etude selection from&nbsp;Le Papillon, Op. 50&nbsp;by Mauro Giuliani,&nbsp;24 Very Easy Exercises, Op. 35,&nbsp;and&nbsp;24 Short Progressive Pieces, Op. 44&nbsp;by Fernando Sor,.\n\nThere is a continuous rise in the difficulty level throughout the method, so it is recommended that you feel comfortable playing the etudes from the first steps before engaging on a harder piece of a later step. You can listen to the whole set of pieces and understand that they do share similar classical vocabulary, therefore knowing one piece WILL make it easier to learn the next one.\n<h4>Requirement</h4>\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRecognizing dotted rhythm and how to reproduce it.</li>\n \t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFamiliarity with dotted rhythm in beginner level repertoire.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>What's next</h4>\nNext course: <a href=\"https://scorewind.com/courses/dotted-rhythm-of-the-classical-era-for-guitar-part-2/\">Dotted Rhythm of the Classical Era for Guitar - Part 2</a>",
