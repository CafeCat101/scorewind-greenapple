This can interrupt the flow your your scale, leading you to not play legato, or press notes wrongly, resulting in a noise. The best way to make position changes during scales is to use the moment you reach to an open string note. Since you're not pressing any note at that moment, your hand is free to move to the next position, without interrupting the sound. Thus, when you reach to the open E on the first string, you'll\u00a0 use that moment to drag your 3rd finger from D to F# on the second string. That way you successfully transfer your hand from the 1st to the 5th position.</p>\n \n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>",

Barr\u00e9s can be done by pressing all the 6 strings with the index, but you can have smaller barr\u00e9s, such as the two and three strings barr\u00e9s. Because this is just an introduction exercise, we will only be practicing the barr\u00e9s of two and three strings. The pressure must be even between the strings you\u2019re pressing.

Stylistically and technically speaking, the guitar arpeggios of this era are characterised by combinations of the right hand finger that create complex textures out of a series of chord progressions. This means that throughout this method you will not be practicing horizontal arpeggios produced by the left hand, but the vertical textures offered by the right hand.\n\nThe method consists of a selection of etudes from&nbsp;<strong>Le Papillon, Op. 50</strong>&nbsp;by Mauro Giuliani,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>24 Progressive Lessons Op. 31</strong>&nbsp;by Fernando Sor.\n\nThere is a continuous rise in the difficulty level throughout the method, so it is recommended that you feel comfortable playing the etudes from the first steps before engaging on a harder piece of a later step.

With each one of these five etudes you will be introduced to the common arpeggio practice and how the composers applied it in their compositions. Stylistically and technically speaking, the guitar arpeggios of this era are characterised by combinations of the right hand finger that create complex textures out of a series of chord progressions. This means that throughout this method you will not be practicing horizontal arpeggios produced by the left hand, but the vertical textures offered by the right hand.\n\nThe method consists of a selection of etudes from&nbsp;<strong>Theme varies et 12 Minuets, Op. 11</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>24 Progressive Lessons Op. 31</strong>&nbsp;by Fernando Sor, and <strong>25 Etudes Melodiques, Op. 60</strong> by Mateo Carcassi.\n\nThere is a continuous rise in the difficulty level throughout the method, so it is recommended that you feel comfortable playing the etudes from the first steps before engaging on a harder piece of a later step.

This way you are going forward in the passage and you reinforce what you just learned previously.

This method is recommended for players who are fluent in music notation reading. Establishing comfort over each piece can take at least a week's time for most of the learners, so no rush!\n\nAlthough technical difficulties of each piece is rather similar within this collected group of pieces, they are not meant to be played precisely with the given order. Yet they can help each other out; since learning classical vocabulary is like learning a new language; knowing one piece WILL make it easier to learn the next one. There is a difficulty level rise to some extend towards the last pieces.

Focus on having a good horizontal alignement between the 1st and 4th finger, and that there is always a fair amount of space between your fingers (this will help you a lot, not only in this case, but for your whole left hand positioning foundation).

The biggest challenge you will encounter in this scale is the incredible extension in the first string between the notes e, f, g, a; an up to the fifth fret stretch. The key here is to open up your left hand knuckles as you reach to the f, in order to be prepared to play the g and the a, and later be ready to descend on the scale. With this type of preparation you will be saving time and effort.

It is always that one value (a half, quarter, eight, sixteenth note) plus its half; so, one and a half value every time. In this case our dotted rhythm will be done with 8th and 16th notes. First you will only play a base of 8th notes, then you\u2019ll subdivide every second 8th note into two 16th notes, and finally you will omit the first 16th note and add the value of that note to the 8th note that you just played.

Making sure that your knuckles are open wide and that the fingertips are just ready to drop on the strings, will help you successfully play parallel thirds. This will avoid lack of legato and eliminate the chance of producing noisy notes. When you have position changes, keep in mind to make the shifts quickly, otherwise you lose legato or it will sound to glissando technique.

In order to keep the legato running, the position shifts must be done quickly, lightly ,and cleanly.

On the second part, the bassline receives the main role, as the melody is transferred to the bass in the more virtuosic passage. Remember that the arpeggio needs to sound clear while you sing the melody with your thumb.</span></p>\n \n<p>\n \n\n<p></p>",

				"course_content": "<h4>Highlights</h4>\n<ul>\n <li>\nPerfecting Alberti bass technique.</li>\n <li>\nPerfecting fast note repetitions with thumb.</li>\n <li>\nPerfecting figuetta technique.</li>\n <li>\nPlaying continuous melodic bass lines (melismatic) with the thumb.</li>\n <li>\nDeveloping the octave technique.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Description</h4>\nWith this course you can greatly improve the dexterity of your right hand\u2019s thumb. It is a finger that is often neglected during practice, as the study focus tends to direct to i, m, a, or to the left hand fingers. The repertoire of the Classical era of the guitar is filled with beautiful bass lines, and there are plenty of passages which are filled with challenging virtuosity. Thus this method will guide you progressively through some of the best examples out there, so that your thumb becomes as accurate as any other of your fingers, which will ultimately give you a well balanced control over the different voices of the music you play.\n\nThe method consists of an etude selection from&nbsp;Le Papillon, Op. 50&nbsp;by Mauro Giuliani,&nbsp;25 Etudes Melodiques, Op. 60, by Matteo Carcassi, and&nbsp;12 Etudes, Op. 6&nbsp;by Fernando Sor.\n\nThere is a continuous rise in the difficulty level throughout the method, so it is recommended that you feel comfortable playing the etudes from the first steps before engaging on a harder piece of a later step. You can listen to the whole set of pieces and understand that they do share similar classical vocabulary, therefore knowing one piece WILL make it easier to learn the next one.\n<h4>Requirement</h4>\n<ul>\n <li>\nIntermediate level of score reading ability.</li>\n <li>\nFamiliarity with melodic arpeggios.</li>\n <li>\nAdvanced level in melody playing in first position.</li>\n <li>\nFluency in playing chords.</li>\n <li>\nAbility to play pieces in C, G, D, A and E Major.</li>\n <li>\nFluency in playing Alberti bass.</li>\n <li>\nFluency in performing parallel voicings (up to 3 voices).</li>\n</ul>",

Each bar follows a progressive path that helps you to decode the infamous rhythmic element. Your left hand will be placed pretty much all the time in the same place (on a G major chord position), and it is your fourth finger that will be doing most of the tricky bits. In order to connect the notes well, you need to pay attention to the coordination of your hands. The movements of your fingers have to happen almost at the same time.\u00a0</p>",
